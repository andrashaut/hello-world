# hello-world
Getting familiar with stuff here.

Just adding a line for some initial commiting. Cool.
Also: no more procrastination ffs. Today I will progress with stuff. One step at a time...
For now I'm familiarizing with GitHub stuff, and some general git workflow. Let's get it!
Oh, and I'm listening to Throwing Snow right now, and that is freakin' amazing, I should put it in the background way more often.
