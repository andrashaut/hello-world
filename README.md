# hello-world
Getting familiar with stuff here.

Just adding a line for some initial commiting. Cool.
Also: no more procrastination ffs. Today I will progress with stuff. One step at a time...
For now I'm familiarizing with GitHub stuff, and some general git workflow. Let's get it!
Oh, and I'm listening to Throwing Snow right now, and that is freakin' amazing, I should put it in the background way more often.

Just a final touch, so I can see what it's like when I draft a pull request, then make some more commits and then finally marking it ready for pulling.
Submitting pull request after this and merging!
